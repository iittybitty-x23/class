    <p> Visible, invisible,
        A fluctuating charm,</p>
    <p>An amber-colored amethyst
            Inhabits it; your arm</p>
    <p>Approaches, and
        It opens and
        It closes;</p>
    <p>You have meant
        To catch it,
        And it shrivels;
        You abandon</p>
    <p>Your intent—
        It opens, and it
        Closes and you
        Reach for it—</p>
    <p>The blue
        Surrounding it
        Grows cloudy, and
        It floats away
        From you.</p>
